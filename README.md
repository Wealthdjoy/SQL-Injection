# SQL Injection project on Auth Bypass &amp; Credential Exfiltration
Ethics & Scope: This project documents testing performed only against an intentionally vulnerable training instance provided for ethical practice. Do not use these techniques on systems you do not own or lack explicit written permission to test.
## Summary
●	Target: Intentionally vulnerable login endpoint (training instance).
●	Goal: Demonstrate SQL injection leading to authentication bypass and exfiltration of stored credentials.
●	Methods:
1.	Manual exploitation via crafted payloads and wordlists.
2.	Automated exploitation using sqlmap.
●	Tooling: Burp Suite (Proxy/Repeater/Intruder), sqlmap, Kali Linux payload wordlists (e.g., SQL.txt), browser.
●	Outcome: Verified SQLi at login, bypassed auth, enumerated DB structure, and dumped user credential records (sanitized in report).
## Skills Demonstrated
●	Web app recon & traffic interception (Burp Proxy)
●	Input tampering & payload testing (error-based, boolean-based, union-based)
●	Automating detection/exploitation with sqlmap
## High-Level Workflow
1.	Proxy setup → route browser through Burp; capture baseline login request.
2.	Manual SQLi testing → inject payloads in username/password; evaluate responses.
3.	Automated verification → run sqlmap against the same request to confirm and enumerate.
4.	Evidence → save key HTTP requests/responses and sanitized DB dumps.
5.	Reporting
